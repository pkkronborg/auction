# Auction
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

# Description
This is my Semester Project 2. The website is built with HTML, SASS, JS, Bootstrap

There are 5 pages: index with all listings (home), create listing, edit listing, detail page and profile page.

* An user can search thorugh all listings, sort by: title, newest and ending soon, and can filter to see only active listings
* A user can register as a registered user, needs to have stud.noroff.no or noroff.no email
* A registered user may login
* A registered user may logout
* A registered user can see their profile and update avatar
* A registered user may create a new listing with media gallery, title, description and end date
* A registered user can add a bid to other registered users listings and see a history of bids
* A registered user can edit and delete their own listings
